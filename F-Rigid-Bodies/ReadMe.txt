This is a project with the intent to create a basic 2D platfromer using no 2D Rigid Bodies or Collision detection. 

Why?  Who knows, I was bored.

Recent Feature adds:
* A prefab that has the world script attached that tells the player where it should land.
* If you rotate platforms on the Z axis, the player character follows the slope.  This is powered by sweet Triangle Math.
* If platform is rotated, the player rotates to the same angle.
