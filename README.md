# Unity3DProjects
Mainly just learning exercises to get more familiar with Unity3D

F-Rigid-Bodies :
Just me tinkering around with creating a 2D platformer without using Rigid Bodies or Collision detection.
The project contains 4 scripts:
Player Script - Handles all player Movement
World Script - Detects if player is above it and within its sprite bounds on the X-Axis
Camera Script - Makes the camera follow the player.  There has been 0 effort in this script and just keeps the player at the center of the frame.
Testing World Angles - A general test script that I attach to game objects to see if I'm getting expected outputs.

Tower Defense Idea :
Playing around with Drag and Drop interfaces.  Nothing really to this yet.  If you click on a tower it moves with the mouse.  It changes the Z position of the object based on the Y position.  Will add image scaling to create the illusion of things futher in background.
