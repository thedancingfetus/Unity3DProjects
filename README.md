# Unity3DProjects
Mainly just learning exercises to get more familiar with Unity3D

F-Rigid-Bodies :
Just me tinkering around with creating a 2D platformer without using Rigid Bodies or Collision detection.  
The project contains 3 scripts:
Player Script - Handles all player Movement
World Script - Detects if player is above it and within its sprite bounds on the X-Axis
Camera Script - Makes the camera follow the player.  There has been 0 effort in this script and just keeps the player at the center of the frame.
