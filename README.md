Mainly just learning exercises to get more familiar with Unity3D

F-Rigid-Bodies :
Just me tinkering around with creating a 2D platformer using no Rigid Bodies or Collision detection.  

Features of this is pretty barebones right now.  I have a square block, and if it's over a rectangle box, it falls until it makes 
contact.  Like I said really basic.
